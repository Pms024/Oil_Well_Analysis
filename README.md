# Oil Well Analysis

Simulate oil well data for analysis & forecasting. Dataset: 1,000 wells, 20 data points each (Jan 2015 - Dec 2022). Features: prod. volume, op. costs, well loc, API gravity, well depth, type (onshore/offshore), & pressure. EDA insights & K-Means clustering for segmentation. ARIMA for production forecasting. Optimize operations & maximize efficiency.

## Data Generation Process Summary

The data generation process aims to create a realistic dataset simulating oil well data for comprehensive analysis and forecasting. The dataset includes 1,000 unique oil wells, each containing 20 randomly generated line items of data, resulting in over 20,000 data points. Production dates span from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2022, capturing diverse production scenarios.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights

- Distribution of Production Volume
- Operating Costs vs. Production Volume (Scatter Plot)
- Distribution of Wells by Location
- Total Production Cost by Location
- Total Production Volume by Location
- Operating Costs vs. Each Year (Line Plot)
- Cumulative Operating Costs by Date and Region (Area Plot)
- Box Plot of Operating Costs vs. Weight of Crude Oil

## Oil Well Segmentation and Analysis

Using K-Means clustering, we segment oil wells based on production volume and operating costs. Six distinct clusters are identified, providing insights into different well groups and potential cost-saving opportunities.

## Oil Production Forecasting using ARIMA

Time series analysis using ARIMA models enables accurate oil production forecasting. We provide yearly and monthly production forecasts based on historical data, allowing better resource planning and decision-making for the future.

## Insights and Recommendations

- Focus on optimizing high-producing wells to maximize output and revenue generation.
- Implement strategies to improve the productivity of low-producing wells.
- Allocate resources and investments based on regional variation and cost-efficiencies in specific well clusters.
- Regularly monitor well performance and operating costs for future production trends.
- Implement data-driven predictive maintenance to optimize well operations and minimize downtime.
- Incorporate risk management strategies to address unexpected fluctuations in production volumes and operating costs.
- Develop contingency plans to mitigate the impact of adverse events on oil well operations.
